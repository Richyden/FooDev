## Presentation
The Chef has a pleasant restaurant with a very revolutionary concept. His concept is to combine the two extreme types of food: junk food and very healthy food !

He has a lot of customers in his restaurant, so it’s time for him to spread his cooking skills through the country. That’s why he will open 2 brand new branches.

To help him to become known and to implement new services for his customers, he needs a website.

To reach his objectives, he contacted a project manager who also is a professional designer, called Casey Ryback. After weeks of work, they finished the design and decided on the features of the future website.

It's at this moment you take action ! Casey calls your team to make the project. He provides you magnificent layouts and gives you precises instructions.

## Client's request
The Chef would like to edit the content of his website regularly because he wants to change his menus often and create new recipes with his collaborators. That’s why a CMS is the best solution to provide for him.

It does not matter what CMS you use, as long as the user interface is easy to understand, and the fields to fill in are clear.

warning This project needs to be customer-oriented. The dashboard for the client has to be clear, easy to use and match the design.

To help you, Casey Ryback gives you the license ACF PRO, a WordPress plugin that will provide you the possibility to create custom fields.

Due to the high standards of the design, the client would like you to respect it strictly.
